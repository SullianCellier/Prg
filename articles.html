                    <h2>Initialization // Local Drift</h2>
                    <p class="date-header">Published on August 28, 2025, at 4:52PM</p>
                    <div class="more-text">
                        <p>Welcome to everyone hopping on the grind and joining the fight. I set this site up after spending weeks spiralling on Reddit and 4chan with people who are in the exact same boat: we need to link up. This is where I’ll be dropping updates on everything we find regarding VCD or the Omission Protocol. Right now, I’m the only one who can post, but I’m down to bring someone else on board later if it makes sense.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To start off, I’m gonna recap what we’ve already put together on Reddit and 4chan. I’d suggest trying to dig up those old threads, even though the system has probably wiped them by now. Lately, we’ve been theorizing about the existence of this global secret society that I’ve decided to call Vertex Core Dynamics, or VCD. We don’t actually know who’s calling the shots yet; we have a few leads, but it’s definitely something we need to dig into more. VCD’s whole deal is keeping society in this forced "happy" state and sidelining anyone who might mess with their vision.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To make that happen, we’ve detected a sort of "prep mode" for people like us who are being phased out: that’s what we’re calling the Omission Protocol. Its main goal is to basically ghost the individual from reality. They’re definitely using some next-level tech—stuff we’ve never seen before—that glitches how people perceive their surroundings. It makes it so people around us barely notice we’re there, or they just don’t see us at all. For some reason, though, it doesn't work on the people closest to us (parents, friends, etc.). Having those pre-existing social ties must act like a buffer against the tech. I’m gonna try to find more info on that.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Personally, the Omission Protocol has been hitting me since I finished high school about four months ago, but it’s been getting way more intense lately. I just moved away from my family and headed to Ontario after getting into uni. Like I said, my parents don't seem affected, and same with my sister. But the other students, the people at the shops near my place, basically everyone else acts like I’m invisible.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>So, we’ve decided to launch a counter-protocol: if people are perpetually avoiding us, we need to take up as much space as possible and make ourselves seen. If we force them to acknowledge us, it glitches the protocol. I’m gonna try to get that started in the next few days and look into the points I mentioned.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I’ll keep you guys posted.</p>

                    <h2>The Signal Void Hypothesis</h2>
                    <p class="date-header">Published on September 5, 2025, at 8:21AM</p>
                    <div class="more-text">
                        <p>Hey everyone, it’s been a week and honestly, so much has happened I don’t even know where to start. Someone on 4chan actually suggested I should stop involving my family and friends in all this. I was pretty skeptical at first, but I think it’s a solid call. I don’t want this protocol spreading any further than it already has, so I’ve decided to stop visiting my fam as much. It shouldn't be too hard to pull off anyway, winter’s basically here and once the snow starts dumping, commuting is gonna be a total nightmare.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I spent most of my time lately digging for answers on the Omission Protocol and I came across the work of Dr. Miguel Nicolelis. He’s a pretty well-known neuroscientist, I’ll spare you the boring details, but look him up if you’re curious. To sum it up, he proved that brain activity can be picked up, translated into code by an encoder, and sent to another brain or a machine. I think what’s happening with the Protocol is just the reverse. The info starts at a source, probably some AI giving the "ignore/forget this person" order and then that order is sent through a decoder, like a computer, a satellite, or even just a cell phone. Finally, that order gets translated into waves or maybe synthetic hormones that hit the receiver’s brain and force them to follow the command.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I also have a theory on why our families seem immune. I’m convinced it’s because they just know us way too well. The tech can’t wipe out the existence of someone you’ve known your whole life. It’s like the social bond is too strong for the signal to override.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I’ve also started testing the counter-protocol I mentioned the other day. Just a reminder: the goal is to be as obvious as possible: talk loud, act random, just take up space. Yesterday on campus, I stood in the middle of the main hallway and started clapping and talking loudly to myself. Within seconds, people finally looked up. A few laughed. One guy asked if I was okay. It felt like the signal broke for a moment. I’m gonna keep at it for a few more days and I’ll share the full results in a couple of weeks. I also want to hear from you guys, tell me about your experiences and theories. I’ve added a contact tab to the homepage. Stay safe.</p>

                    <h2>Counter-Protocol Failed: System Adaptation</h2>
                    <p class="date-header">Published on November 28, 2025, at 11:03PM</p>
                    <div class="more-text">
                        <p>Hey, it’s been a minute since my last post. To be honest, I haven’t really made any progress, none at all. The counter-protocol is a total bust. No matter how much I ramp it up or change my approach, nothing works. I think VCD just adapted; people don’t even care anymore, they’re just ignoring me even harder now. The only real "shift" is with this group of older students who basically treat me like a total clown every time they see me. I didn’t realize the protocol could actually evolve like that, using people to isolate me even more. I’ve been reading through all your messages and it sounds like you’re dealing with the same dead ends. So yeah, I’m officially burying the counter-protocol.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>A few of you suggested I talk to someone who wouldn’t judge, like a therapist. I thought about it, but I’m not convinced they could actually do anything for me. The logical move would be the police, but without any hard proof, I can already tell that’s a non-starter. My only real option is my sister. I know she won’t snitch, and I trust her enough to know she won’t drag our parents into this.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Despite the L, I’m trying to focus on the positives. It’s supposed to snow like crazy over the next few weeks, which is actually a win because it’s getting way harder to avoid my family. My mom called the other day saying she was worried about me, lmao, if only she knew I’m the one worried about them. I’m just gonna go full hermit mode until the end of winter and pretend I’m just grinding for finals. Hopefully, that’ll give me some breathing room to find a way to beat VCD.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I’m honestly starting to wonder what the next stage of the Omission Protocol even is. None of my theories feel right anymore. I feel like I’m becoming a ghost, physically here but totally invisible. And looking back, I think this started way longer ago than I realized, maybe even when I was a kid. I’ve always been solo. It’s like I’m just a lab rat for those VCD losers. I’m terrified that the next step is gonna be something way more dark. If nobody can see me, they can basically do whatever they want, kidnap me, torture me... I don’t even want to imagine what they’d do now that I’m actually digging into their business. I’ve hit the point of no return, but I’m not giving up. I’m staying in, keeping my head down, and only heading out for groceries or to grab books from the campus library to find some real answers.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Take care of yourselves and your people.</p>

                        <p>Hey everyone, I’m just gonna be straight with you, things have been a total mess lately.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>A few days after my last post, I ended up explaining everything to my sister. I really thought she’d keep it on the low and maybe even help me out, so I was honestly blindsided when she showed up at my place earlier this week with my parents. She told them everything, and they decided to come down for Christmas.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The reason I haven’t posted is because I’ve actually been seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I’ve been on meds for a few days now, and I’m starting to feel a bit better. I definitely wasn’t in a "normal" headspace over the last few months. We don’t have a final diagnosis yet, but things have been pretty rough, and I’m honestly ashamed I didn’t realize what was happening sooner.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I haven’t mentioned this site to the doctors. I’m not sure if I should just delete it or leave it online as a cautionary tale, I’m pretty lost right now. I’ve stopped going to classes for the time being, and I don't even know if I’ll go back after this whole disaster, or if I’ll even be allowed to.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I want to thank the people who tried to convince me to see a doctor. And honestly, I want to apologize to anyone I might have influenced or dragged into my delusions. Even though I wasn’t really conscious of what I was doing, I still feel guilty about it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This is definitely the last time I’m posting here. I hope you guys find some real happiness and keep fighting your demons.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Something fucking disturbing just happened. I know I said the last post was gonna be it, but I’ve been thinking a lot and I just uncovered something way worse, something straight-up inhuman.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>My folks only stayed for a few days before they had to head back once their time off was up. I’m back to being totally alone, and that’s when it hit me: VCD orchestrated everything. This is all my fault. I’m convinced that as soon as I looped my sister in, they pulled the trigger on their endgame to get rid of me. My own family has been manipulated and turned against me, and those doctors? They’re straight-up accomplices in this plot.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I was being fucking drugged with those meds they prescribed. I stopped taking them a few days ago because they were just making me weak, exhausted, and way too easy to control. I almost fell for their trap, but I’m not letting them play me with that bullshit anymore.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I’ve been holed up in my place for a month now. I rarely go out because, lately, I’m being followed. I can feel it, it’s almost over.</p>
